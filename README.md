# PitchDetector - Sound recognition using Android Wear (Diploma Thesis)

ABSTRACT
	My diploma thesis deals with the issue of sound recognition using Android Wear platform. The opening chapters describe what Android Wear platform actually is and what its possibilities are. Also this thesis defines the sound itself, its physical properties, relation to musical notes and compares different types of tuning. Last but not least, the possibilities of sound recognition are presented from the signal processing point of view focusing on pitch detection algorithms.
	The main goal is to create my own sound recognition solution based on the known theoretical knowledge. The solution will be demonstrated by designing and developing a smart watch app capable of recognizing guitar tones through its microphone. The app will be used to detemine the played notes and to tune the guitar. The work also includes a selection of ideal monophonic pitch detection algorithm with appropriate accuracy regarding smart watches limitations.
